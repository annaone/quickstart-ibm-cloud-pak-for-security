== FAQ

*Q.* Where can I get my Red Hat pull secret?

*A.* Go to the following link to obtain the pull secret: https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned[OpenShift Installer Provisioned Infrastructure pull secret^].

*Q.* Where can I get my IBM private registry password?

*A.* Go to the following link to obtain the IBM private registry password: https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary[IBM Container Library^].

*Q.* Where can I get my SOAR Entitlement ?

*A.* Go to the following link to obtain the IBM SOAR Entitlement :  https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-security/1.9?topic=planning-licensing-entitlement[SOAR Entitlement].

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance is left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue. (For Windows, look at the log files in %ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and C:\cfn\log.)
// If you’re deploying on Linux instances, provide the location for log files on Linux, or omit this sentence.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For additional information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^] on the AWS website.

*Q.* I encountered a size limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^] in the AWS documentation.

*Q.* What happen to all the resources which created automatically if our stack creation fails.

*A.* It will Roll_Back automatically and all the resources which are part of deployment also deleted.
